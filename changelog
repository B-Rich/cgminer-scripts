cgminer (2.3.6-1) stable; urgency=low

  Version 2.3.6 - April 29, 2012
  - Shorten stale share messages slightly.
  - Protect the freeing of current_hash under mutex_lock to prevent racing on it
    when set_curblock is hit concurrently.
  - Change default behaviour to submitting stale, removing the --submit-stale
    option and adding a --no-submit-stale option.
  - Make sure to start the getwork and submit threads when a pool is added on the
    fly. This fixes a crash when a pool is added to running cgminer and then
    switched to.
  - Faster hardware can easily outstrip the speed we can get work and submit
    shares when using only one connection per pool.
  - Test the queued list to see if any get/submits are already queued and if they
    are, start recruiting extra connections by generating new threads.
  - This allows us to reuse network connections at low loads but recuit new open
    connections as they're needed, so that cgminer can scale to hardware of any
    size.
